# Fire Chicken Context Sensitive Dictation
This repository offers code for overriding the default behavior of the talon community repository context sensitive dictation to make customization easier. Offering a specific version specifically for Microsoft Word on a windows machine is planned.

# Settings
user.fire_chicken_context_sensitive_dictation_copy_delay: determines how long in milliseconds to pause before copying text to prevent the scenario of accidentally copying nothing. Default: 200.
